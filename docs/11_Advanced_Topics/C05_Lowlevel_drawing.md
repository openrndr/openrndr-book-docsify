 
 # Lowlevel Drawing

This text is intended for developers looking to provide drawing functionality that is fully independent of 
the `Drawer` class. Developers that desire to do so will essentially use the same building blocks that OPENRNDR
uses internally.
    
A good reference for lowlevel drawing is the `Filter` class and it is encouraged to look at its [source code](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr/blob/master/openrndr-core/src/main/kotlin/org/openrndr/draw/Filter.kt)
as it provides a good idea of how all the lowlevel components interact and its implementation is fully independent from
`Drawer`.
    
All lowlevel drawing is performed using OPENRNDR's `Driver` class. This class provides a handful of functions for
drawing. Below you will find a list of the essential ones.
 * `Driver.setState()`    
 * `Driver.drawVertexBuffer()`
 * `Driver.drawIndexedVertexBuffer()`        
 * `Driver.drawInstances()`
 * `Driver.drawIndexedInstances()`
 
Classes that belong to the lowlevel drawing API:
 * [`Shader`](https://api.openrndr.org/org.openrndr.draw/-shader/index.html)
 * [`IndexBuffer`](https://api.openrndr.org/org.openrndr.draw/-index-buffer/index.html)
 * [`VertexBuffer`](https://api.openrndr.org/org.openrndr.draw/-vertex-buffer/index.html)
 * [`VertexFormat`](https://api.openrndr.org/org.openrndr.draw/-vertex-format/index.html)
 * [`ColorBuffer`](https://api.openrndr.org/org.openrndr.draw/-color-buffer/index.html)
 * [`DepthBuffer`](https://api.openrndr.org/org.openrndr.draw/-depth-buffer/index.html)
 * [`ArrayTexture`](https://api.openrndr.org/org.openrndr.draw/-array-texture/index.html)
 * [`CubeMap`](https://api.openrndr.org/org.openrndr.draw/-cubemap/index.html)
 * [`DrawStyle`](https://api.openrndr.org/org.openrndr.draw/-draw-style/index.html)
 * [`RenderTarget`](https://api.openrndr.org/org.openrndr.draw/-render-target/index.html)

We discourage writing code that uses OpenGL directly; even though currently only an OpenGL 3.3 implementation exists 
for `Driver`, in the future we may add implementations that are not based on OpenGL.       
 
 ## Example
        
In the following example we show the minimum steps required for drawing a single triangle.

 ```kotlin
program {
    val geometry = vertexBuffer(vertexFormat {
        position(3) // -- this attribute is named "position"
    }, 3)
    
    geometry.put {
        for (i in 0 until geometry.vertexCount) {
            write(Vector3(2.0 * Math.random() - 1.0, 2.0 * Math.random() - 1.0, 0.0))
        }
    }
    
    // -- code for the vertex shader
    val vs = """
            #version 330                
            in vec3 a_position;  // -- driver adds a_ prefix (a for attribute)
            void main() {
                gl_Position = vec4(a_position, 1.0);                
            }
            """
    
    // -- code for the fragment shader
    val fs = """
            #version 330
            out vec4 o_output;
            void main() {
                o_output = vec4(1.0);                                                                                                                
            }                                                                
            """
    
    val shader = Shader.createFromCode(vs, fs)
    
    extend {
        shader.begin()
        Driver.instance.drawVertexBuffer(shader, listOf(geometry), DrawPrimitive.TRIANGLES, 0, 3)
        shader.end()
    }
}
```
